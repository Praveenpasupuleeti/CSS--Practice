            <p>A paragraph is a distinct section of written text,
             typically composed of multiple sentences, that focuses
             on a single idea or topic. It serves as a fundamental 
             building block for organizing longer pieces of writing, 
             making them more readable and understandable. Paragraphs 
             are generally indicated by indentation of the first line, 
             although some styles may use extra spacing between paragraphs instead.
